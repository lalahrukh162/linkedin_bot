# linkedin_bot
A Streamlit-based LinkedIn automation bot that uses Selenium and proxy rotation to log into multiple accounts, search for jobs, apply filters, and auto-submit “Easy Apply” applications. It handles authentication via cookies, bypasses LinkedIn detection, and fills dynamic job forms intelligently.
